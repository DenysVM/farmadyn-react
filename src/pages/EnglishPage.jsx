        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Children at the pumpkin farm remain under the direct supervision of
            parents or guardians.
          </li>
          <li>
            Animals can only be fed by adults. Do not put hands into the
            mouths of animals. Keep your head at least half a metre away from
            geese, chickens and turkeys – they can peck. Pampas grasses are
            sharp and can cut your hand, so please be careful with children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not lift or squeeze rabbits; feed only those rabbits that want
            to eat. A rabbit resting in its house means it wants to relax.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not pick corn or other plants from the decorations. Put
            pumpkins back in their place and do not throw them. Do not climb
            higher than one metre off the ground on any decorations, straw
            bales or other elements of the farm.
          </li>
          <li>Do not topple the straw in the maze.</li>
          <li>
            On swings we swing low and carefully; children must be supervised
            by adults. A maximum of five children of similar weight may be on
            the trampoline at one time, without shoes. The zip line is for
            children up to 65 kg. Safety glasses are mandatory in the Nerf
            zone. Decorative grasses can be sharp on hands. Failure to follow
            staff instructions may result in removal from the facility. People
            who intentionally spoil the fun for children or fail to supervise
            their charges may be asked to leave. Our priority is the fun and
            safety of children and adults. Welcome and have fun.
